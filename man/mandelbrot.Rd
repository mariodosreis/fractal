\title{The Mandelbrot Set}
\usage{
mandelbrot(x = c(-2, 1), y = c(-1.5, 1.5), nx = 600, ny = 600,
  iter = 80)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{x limits}

\item{y}{y limits}

\item{nx}{x resolution}

\item{ny}{y resolution}

\item{iter}{maximum number of iterations}
}
\value{
A list with components: \code{x}, a vector of x coordinates (real
part), \code{y}, a vector of y coordinates (imaginary part), and \code{z},
a \code{nx} * \code{ny} matrix with the number of interations used to
evalute the complex point \eqn{c = x + yi}.
}
\description{
A function to calculate the Mandelbrot set
}
\details{
The set is obtained by iterating \eqn{z_{j+1}=z_j+c} where
\eqn{z} and \eqn{c} are complex numbers. The initial value of \eqn{z},
\eqn{z_0} is 0, and the value of \eqn{c} is chosen arbitrarily.
It can be shown that if after a certain number of iterations the modulus of
\eqn{Z} is greater than 2, then the value of \eqn{z} will head off to
infinity. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of points \eqn{c} in the
complex plane for which the iteration procedure is bound.
